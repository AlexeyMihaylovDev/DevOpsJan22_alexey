#my git_ex1 exercise answers :

Git Basics :

1. echo "1" > abc.txt
2. "red color" because the file not in index

3. "green color" after adding file to index (git add abc.txt && git commit -m "adding abc.txt file")

4. echo "2" >> abc.txt
5. "blue color"

6. git diff or git diff main

7. because i dont have staged files for the next commit

8. its a invalid argument because i dont have stage2 HEAD(or any hash or branch) in my repository

9. git add abc.txt
10. prints nothing because all my files is staged in index ( git diff only shows unstaged changes (--staged/--cached option showing staged changes))

11. git diff ---cached or --staged in more recent versions of git

12. echo "3" >> abc.txt
13. No, the output is different because git diff main shows unstaged changes also and git diff --staged shows only the staged changes !

14. Because the same reason as above,  the green color for "changes to be committed" and red color for "changes not stage for commit"

15. git reset -- abc.txt for remove the staged files in index and git restore -- abc.txt for unstaged files in working tree
